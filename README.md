# Algosnake
Simple 2D search algorithm sandbox


As I was playing an open-world game the other night I wondered how efficient different algorithms were for moving through a simple 2-dimensional space. This is a very basic 2D grid where a "snake" moves through it trying to collect all the placed objectives (Blue blocks). There can also be hazards, or roadblocks, to prevent the progress of the snake. This can allow testing of different path finding algorithms with and without metrics and memory of past paths. 

Block colors:

White = Normal unexplored block  
Grey = Explored block  
Blue = Objective block  
Red = Roadblock block  
Green = Start point/Current position.
